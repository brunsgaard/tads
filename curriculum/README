Curriculum

(MT) Distance oracles in undirected graphs
At the exam I will expect you to know the construction for the metric case where the input is a complete distance matrix.. the rest is cursory.

22/4: (MT) Distance oracles in planar graphs
At the exam I expect you to know the reachability oracle - the rest is cursory.

27/4: (SA) Decremental connectivity in trees
For the paper "Optimal Online Deremental Connetivity in Trees" you should know the whole paper, wheras for "Nearest Common Ancestors: A Survey and a New Algorithm for a Distributed Environment" its only chapter 4.


29/4: (Ola Svensson, EPFL) Algorithms for the symmetric traveling salesman problem
For the exam I expect you to know Christofides 1.5 approximation MST algorithm. The rest is cursory.


4/5: (PW) Kinetic Data Structures

6/5: (PW) Kinetic Alpha Complexes and Applications



11/5: (CWN) Fully-Dynamic Graph Connectivity


13/5: (Bob Tarjan [Turing Award Winner], Princeton) Hollow Heaps


18/5: (CWN) Fully-Dynamic Minimum Spanning Forest
